# Bike Purchases Dashboard

The **Bike Purchases Dashboard** is a data analysis project that focuses on understanding the purchasing patterns of bike customers across various demographic and behavioral factors. This dashboard aims to help business and marketing teams identify customer segments, improve targeting, and develop strategies to boost bike sales.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to identify the factors that influence bike purchases, such as demographics, income levels, commute distances, and regional trends. By analyzing these factors, we can address questions like:
- Which customer segments are most likely to purchase bikes?
- Does income or commute distance influence the decision to buy a bike?
- How do regional and demographic variations impact bike sales?

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before creating the dashboard, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to better understand the dataset and identify key patterns and relationships. Key steps and findings from the EDA include:

### 1. Data Cleaning
- **Missing Values**: Checked for missing values across the dataset, and minimal missing data was found, which was addressed appropriately.
- **Data Types**: Verified and adjusted data types to ensure correct formatting for analysis (e.g., converting numerical columns, categorizing age groups).
- **Outliers**: Identified and examined potential outliers in income and commute distance to ensure they didnâ€™t skew the analysis.

### 2. Descriptive Statistics
- **Income**: Calculated average income and identified variations between different customer segments.
- **Age**: Segmented the age data into groups (Adolescent, Middle Age, and Old) to analyze trends across life stages.
- **Commute Distance**: Reviewed average commute distance to understand common commuting patterns.

## Key Sections and Metrics in the Dashboard

### 1. Marital Status and Region Breakdown

- **Marital Status**: Displays segmentation of bike purchasers based on their marital status (Married or Single). Helps identify if marital status influences purchasing behavior, informing targeted marketing campaigns.
- **Region**: Categorizes purchases by geographical region (Europe, North America, and Pacific). Regional insights allow for location-based marketing strategies and understanding market demand across different areas.

### 2. Bike Purchases by Commute Distance

- **Objective**: Analyzes bike purchases based on customers' commute distances, helping to identify if commuting patterns affect bike buying behavior.
- **Miles Range**: Includes ranges of 0-1 Miles, 1-2 Miles, 2-5 Miles, 5-10 Miles, and More than 10 Miles.
- **Purchase Data**:
  - "Yes" and "No" labels represent whether the person bought a bike or not, categorized by distance.
  - This metric could be valuable in targeting campaigns toward customers who may need bikes for short commutes.

### 3. Bike Purchases by Age Group

- **Age Segmentation**: Purchases are analyzed by age group categories: Adolescent (0-31), Middle Age (32-55), and Old (55+).
- **Insights**:
  - Middle-aged customers (32-55) have the highest number of purchases.
  - Useful for age-targeted strategies, such as specific bike models for different age groups or promotions that resonate with these demographics.

### 4. Average Income per Purchase by Gender

- **Income and Gender**: Shows the average income of bike purchasers, segmented by gender (Female and Male).
- **Income Levels**:
  - Male customers who purchased bikes have a higher average income compared to female customers.
  - Income data helps in pricing strategies and understanding purchasing power, which can be used for promotions targeting different income groups.

## Insights & Solutions

This dashboard provides valuable insights and actionable solutions for key business challenges:

### 1. Customer Demographic Analysis
- **Insight**: Middle-aged customers have the highest purchase rate, and marital status impacts purchasing decisions.
- **Solution**: Create customer personas based on age, marital status, and gender to develop targeted campaigns and promotional materials tailored to each demographic.

### 2. Commute Distance and Bike Usage Patterns
- **Insight**: Customers with shorter commute distances (0-1 Miles) are more likely to purchase bikes, indicating a preference for short-distance commuting.
- **Solution**: Promote bikes as an eco-friendly and economical choice for short commutes, with special campaigns targeting urban areas where short commutes are common.

### 3. Income Influence on Purchasing Behavior
- **Insight**: Higher-income individuals are more likely to purchase bikes, especially among male customers.
- **Solution**: Design premium product lines and exclusive promotions targeting higher-income groups. For lower-income groups, offer financing options or entry-level models to broaden the market.

### 4. Regional and Demographic Segmentation
- **Insight**: There are noticeable differences in bike purchases across regions, with specific demographics performing better in certain areas.
- **Solution**: Use region-specific marketing strategies, such as promoting bike models that align with regional demand, and allocate inventory based on regional preferences.

## Project Analysis Goals

This dashboard provides several pathways for deeper analysis:

- **Customer Demographic Analysis**: Examine how marital status, age, and gender relate to purchasing behavior to create detailed customer personas.
- **Commute Distance and Bike Usage Patterns**: Understand which segments are most likely to purchase bikes for transportation purposes.
- **Income Influence on Purchasing Behavior**: Design products or campaigns based on customer financial capabilities, potentially adjusting for higher-income markets.
- **Regional and Demographic Segmentation**: Understand geographical differences in demand to guide stock allocation and regional marketing investments.
